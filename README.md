My final project for CPSC-326 is a list extension for our MyPL programming language that we developed over the course of the semester. 
It includes basic list function calls and attributes that can be found in Python list structures. To compile and run my example programs, 
open the directory and perform the following call in the terminal (Note: ensure that the filename includes the path to the examples folder):

python mypl.py [filename]

I have also included a live demo of the overview of my implementation as well as a walkthrough of some of my example programs that I wrote.
The presentation and video can be found in the youtube link below. Email me if you have any troubles viewing it. Thank you and I hope you
enjoy my hard work!
